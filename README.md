remote access to phone
Development of an android application providing a background service. Main objective of this app is to remotely access target phone from
any other phone(not necessarily android smartphone). All this is done using the inbuilt messaging service available in all kind of cell-phones, so the whole process can be done offline, no Internet access is required. Features like getting missed call notiÔ¨Åcations, lock phone, getting desired contact numbers etc. are implemented.
